								<h1>My Dear Rachel,</h1>
							</header>

							<p>I find it ridiculous that the letter I want to write for you doesn’t even fit in this disproportionally large Valentine’s Day card, but here it is. I’ve written love letters before. I mean, I was a pretty cheesy kid to start with. Some letters were poems that I got “inspiration” from the internet, others were full of many sweet words that could come to my mind, none of them meant something though, so I’ll try to deviate from that.</p>

							<p>I believe it’s hard to show our true selves to anyone; as humans, we always attempt to show everyone the ideal version of ourselves, whether that'd be by acting more formal in front of others that you've just met or trying to be more funny than usual in order to seem friendly. I struggle with this myself. However, I’ve never seem to have that problem in your presence. When I’m around you, I don’t feel the need to be anyone else or to showcase a better version of myself because you make me feel loved.</p>

							<p>Love, a four-letter word that we use quite often nowadays. It’s talked about by many, but felt only by few. I feel like I’ve said this word many times to many people, but with you I don't even try saying it. I mean, what else could I say when I look into those beautiful eyes right before I kiss you? Well, yes I could say "release the kraken" but I prefer to just say "I love you". I say I love you while I hug you because I don’t want to stop hugging you, I say I love you while I kiss you because I wish those kisses could last a lifetime. Call me naïve or dumb but I truly think I love you. Yes, this 19-year-old Dominican boy loves you and wants to spend as much of his time as he can with you. I’m not clingy because I want to, I’m clingy because I have to! And thank God you’re clingier than me.</p>

							<p>I hope you understand I’ve never felt this way before and all of this is new to me. I’m trying really hard to be the best boyfriend I possibly can, and even though the toughest times in our relationship are ahead of us, I know we’ll be fine.</p>

							<p>Much like this letter love is confusing, but I still love you. I love you not only for what you are,
							but for what I am when I am with you. I love you not only for what you have made of yourself,
							but for what you are making of me.
							</p>

							<p>Happy Valentine’s Day.</p>

							<p>Yours most sincerely, <br>
								Brian Ramirez</p>
